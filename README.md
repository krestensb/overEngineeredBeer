# Over Engineered Beer
The place where we build a fully automatic small scale beer brewing system. 

I've seen many attemps to build an automatic brewing system, but all I've seen is only aiming at controlling temperature and building at nice user interface to monitor temperature.

With the system we are going to build, you add your ingredients and then you go to work.
